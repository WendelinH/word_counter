# Project Idea: **Word Counter**

## Description:
Create a command-line tool that counts the number of words in a given text file. The program should read the file, split it into words, and output the total count.

## Steps to Implement:

1. **Set up a new Rust project:**
Create a new Rust project using the Cargo package manager. Open a terminal and run the following command:
`cargo new word_counter`

2. **Read the input file:**
Write code to read the contents of a text file specified as a command-line argument. You can use the std::fs module to handle file I/O.

3. **Split the text into words:**
Take the text read from the file and split it into individual words. You can use the split_whitespace() method provided by the str type.

4. **Count the words:**
Count the number of words in the text by iterating over the split words and incrementing a counter variable.

5. **Display the result:**
Output the total count of words to the console.

6. **Handle errors:**
Add error handling logic to handle cases such as file not found, read errors, or any other unexpected issues that may arise.

## Further Enhancements:
Once you have a working word counter, you can enhance it with additional features. Here are a few ideas:
- Implement options to count lines or characters in addition to words.
- Provide statistics like the average word length or the most frequent words.
- Support processing multiple files or an entire directory.
- Create a simple graphical user interface using a Rust GUI library.
